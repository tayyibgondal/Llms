You need to write out the calculation for getting the final answer.\\nInput:\\nGun violence in the United States results in tens of thousands of deaths and injuries annually, and was the leading cause of death for children 19 and younger in 2020.  In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\\nOutput:\\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 -  30470 = 7920.\\nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\\n\\nInstruction: How can individuals and organizations reduce unconscious bias?\\nInput:\\n<noinput>\\nOutput:\\nA good place to start is by slowing down — decisions are more likely to be affected by unconscious biases when they are made quickly or under stress. Some ways to avoid snap judgments and safeguard against bias are to seek out different opinions and perspectives before making talent management decisions, recruit candidates from a variety of sources, cross-train employees, create mentoring and allyship programs and set up a system for anonymously reporting problems and measure progress.\\n\\nInstruction: Given a sentence and a number, return the word that correspond to the location of the given number in the sentence, where each word is a white-space separated and the location index starts from 1.\\nInput:\\nThis is a random sentence. 4\\nOutput:\\nrandom\\n\\n\""
